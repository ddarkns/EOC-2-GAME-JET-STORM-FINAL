Jet Storm is a 2D fighter jet game that challenges the player to navigate the skies while avoiding incoming obstacles. The game offers a fast-paced and action-packed experience, requiring quick reflexes and precise control to survive. Player must stay alert to dodge obstacles and take down enemy aircraft while aiming for a high score.
Player takes control of a fighter jet using responsive keyboard controls, allowing movement in directionsâ€”up, and down. The goal is to dodge obstacles and survive as long as possible while maintaining control of the jet. As the game progresses, obstacles become more frequent and unpredictable, making movement even more challenging.
By pressing the spacebar, the player can fire bullets at enemy aircraft. Each successful hit earns 1 point, encouraging quick reactions and precise shooting. However, missing shots may increase the number of incoming jets making it more difficult for the player, requiring constant focus and even if the fight jet crashes into the incoming jet, the game ends.
